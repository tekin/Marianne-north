    For the next two months I enjoyed the society of my friends in London, and then began to think of carrying out my
    original plan of going to Brazil, to continue the collection of studies of tropical plants which I had begun in
    Jamaica. In 1872 I started in the Neva Royal Mail Ship on the 9th of August with a letter from Mr. R. Gr. to the
    captain. <span class="redacted">I had a most comfortable cabin, quite a little room, with a square window, and the voyage was most
    enjoyable</span>. Lisbon was our first halt, which we reached on the 13th at sunset; the entrance to the harbour is
    striking, with the semi-Moorish tower and convent of Bela in the foreground; the domes and tall houses of the city
    gave me a much grander idea of the place than it deserved when investigated nearer: on the 19th we stopped to coal
    at St. Vincent.
  </p><p>
    I did not land on that treeless island, which looked like a great cinder itself; but the boats which surrounded the
    ships were full of pretty things from Madeira, baskets and inlaid boxes, feather-flowers and fine cobwebby knitting,
    as well as monkeys and love-birds from the coast of Africa. On the 28th of August 1872 we cast anchor at daylight
    off Pernambuco, and I saw the long reef with its lighthouse and guardian breakers stretching out between us and the
    land, and wondered how the crowd of ships with their tall masts ever got into the harbour. Seen through my glass,
    the buildings of the town looked much like those of any other town, but beyond were endless groves of
    cocoanut-trees, showing clearly in what part of the world we were. "Friend, a walk on shore will do thee good ; my
    husband hath work to do there, and where he goeth I can go, and where I can go thee canst also," said a dear old
    Quakeress of New York to me ; so I fetched my umbrella and prepared to follow the leader of our landing -party (a
    Belgian) down the ladder into the boat, but he went too fast and far, a wave went right over him, and we had to come
    up again while he changed all his clothes, for he was completely soaked. Our next start was more fortunate; we all
    watched till the boat was on the top of the swell and then dropped ourselves in cleverly one by one.

    It is often quite impossible to land at Pernambuco for many days together, and yet in this stormy sea, which is full
    of sharks, one sees the native fishermen floating about on the rudest kind of rafts, like hencoops, with their legs
    in the water. The planks which form these rafts are so much more under than above the water that the men seem to sit
    on the actual waves as one sees them in the distance, and being black they fear no sharks. Our row over the surf was
    easy enough, though the white breakers on the coral reef looked angry on either side of us. Inside, the harbour is
    calm as a millpond, and we soon stood under the great umbrella-trees in the principal square. It was Sunday, and the
    shops were shut with as much rigour as in Glasgow itself. I saw little to buy but parrots, oranges, and bananas; no
    ladies were about, they were all in church, and as my Quaker friend had told us nothing should induce him to take
    his hat off in those temples of idolatry, we did not attempt to enter the somewhat tawdry-looking buildings. But
    though the upper class of women was wanting, there were plenty of negresses in the streets, whose gaycoloured
    striped shawls hung over their heads and shoulders in the most picturesque folds; and in the suburb gardens we saw
    grand palms and other tropical plants new to me.
  </p><p>
    The fan-palm of Madagascar was perhaps the most remarkable, with its long oar-like leaves and stalks wonderfully
    fitted together in the old Grecian plait, each stalk forming a perfect reservoir of pure water, easily tapped from the
    trunk ; thirsty travellers had good reason for naming this palm or strelitzia their friend. The Frangipani-trees were
    also in great beauty, covered with yellow or salmon-tinted waxen bunches of sweetscented flowers shaped like large
    azaleas, but as yet almost leafless. The flowers go on blooming for many weeks, then come the leaves, and with them a
    huge black and orange caterpillar with a red head, which eats them all up in a very short time; in spite of this the
    vitality of the tree is so great that it soon flowers again.
